<h1>Bhahubali</h1>
<p1>Baahubali: The Beginning is a 2015 Indian epic action film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni under Arka Media Works. Shot simultaneously in Telugu and later in Tamil languages, the film features an ensemble cast including Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty, Tamannaah, Ramya Krishna, Sathyaraj, and Nassar. The first of two cinematic parts, the film follows Shivudu / Shiva, an adventurous young man who helps his love Avanthika rescue Devasena, the former queen of Mahishmati who is now a prisoner under the tyrannical rule of king Bhallaladeva. The story concludes in Baahubali 2: The Conclusion.<br>

<p2>The film was written by Rajamouli's father K. V. Vijayendra Prasad, who randomly told him a story about Sivagami, a woman who carries a baby in her hand while crossing a river, and a few years later about Kattappa, which intrigued Rajamouli. His fascination with mythology and the tales of the Amar Chitra Katha comics further fuelled his interest in the story. However, it took the writers three months to complete the final draft. The soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani while the cinematography, production design, and VFX were handled by K. K. Senthil Kumar, Sabu Cyril </p2>

<h2>1.Plot</h2>

<P>Near the ancient Indian kingdom of Mahishmati, an injured woman named Sivagami is seen exiting a cave down by a mountain waterfall carrying an infant. She kills two soldiers pursuing and attempts to cross a raging river, but slips and is washed away in the current. Before drowning, she holds the baby aloft with her hand and prays to Lord Shiva, demanding that the baby who is Mahendra Baahubali, must live. The baby is saved by the people of the local Amburi tribe, who reside near the river and worship Lord Shiva. Despite the villagers' pleas to take the baby back up the mountain to where he came from, the wife of the tribe's chieftain, Sanga, decides to adopt him and keep him from harm. She names the baby as Shivudu (Shiva).<br>
Shiva grows up to be an ambitious and mischievous child, obsessed with the goal of ascending the mountain, curious to explore what is the top. Despite Sanga's continuous pleas, he constantly tries and fails repeatedly, albeit improving at each attempt. At the young age of 25, he is shown to possess superhuman strength when he lifts a Lingam of Shiva and places it at the foot of the mountain. He later finds a mask that has apparently fallen from the top of the mountain. Realizing it may possess feminine features, he is motivated to scale the mountain and succeeds, albeit with difficulty. At the top, he witnesses a woman named Avantika slaying Mahishmati soldiers. He discovers that she is a warrior from a local resistance tribe, dedicated to the aim of overthrowing the tyrannical king of Mahishmati, Lord Bhallaladeva (Bhalvalathevan) and rescuing an important captive - Princess Devasena, who happens to be the sister of the resistance's chief, Jaya Varma. Shivu is instantly smitten with Avantika and secretly follows her, even managing to draw a tattoo on her hand (while she is sleeping). Eventually, she discovers Shiva and attacks him, but Shiva overpowers her, then returns her mask to her. Realizing that he had scaled the mountain just for her, she reciprocates his feelings.
